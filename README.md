# Graceful
Data analysis python code for the Graceful project 

All code is presenting in Jupyter notebook format for easier clarity and exportability: https://jupyter.org/
To directly view the notebook in your browser, copy-paste the file link into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

For the sake of versality a single time serie in csv format is used as the data source (data.csv).

The SSA method depends on a python class located in the mssa_toolbox.py file
